# Simversion: Simulated genome assemblies

* Evolve two assemblies from an ancestral sequence, with SNVs and SVs (insertions, deletions and inversions).
* Takes either an input genome in fasta format or a sequence length for a randomly generated genome.
* SV lengths can be either drawn from a random exponential distribution with predefined mean, or from a set of discrete categories.
* Run `python simversion.py -h` for help.
